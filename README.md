# Ready for Review Definitions

This repository aims to contain various definitions of 'ready for review' tailored to different types of software development. These definitions are intended to help developers determine when their work is ready for peer review. The ultimate goal is to cover a wide range of development types, including:

- iOS development
- Android development
- React Native development
- general mobile development
- macOS development
- Windows development
- general desktop application development
- general web development
- general back-end development
- and more...

At present, the repository includes one definition, which is for mobile development. I plan to expand this collection over time to include definitions for other types of development.

## Structure

Each definition typically takes the form of a checklist, although this is not a strict requirement. The goal is to provide clear criteria to ensure consistency and quality across code reviews.

## Use Case

For a detailed explanation of the use case for these definitions, please check out my accompanying [blog post](link-to-blog-post).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a definition or checklist you'd like to add, please open a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing format and provide a brief explanation of your checklist.
